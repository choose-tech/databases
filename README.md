## Structure

Content is located in the `content` directory. There are 4 available collections:

1. `categories` ([view structure](https://github.com/choose-tech/astro-integration/blob/main/packages/integration/collections.ts#L6))
2. `libraries` ([view structure](https://github.com/choose-tech/astro-integration/blob/main/packages/integration/collections.ts#L6))
3. `github` (autogenerated)
4. `npm` (autogenerated)

Logos from libraries are stored in `assets/content/libraries`, preferably as `png`, `jpg` or `svg`.
